# Serverlytics
 Serverlytics is an open source serverless analytics platform built on AWS that allows you to collect and analyze data from various sources in a secure and scalable way. It is designed to be flexible, customizable, and easy to use.

### Why use server-side analytics?
There are several reasons why you might choose to use server-side analytics over client-side analytics some these include;

- GDPR and privacy concerns: With the implementation of GDPR and other data privacy regulations, it is becoming increasingly important to ensure that data is collected and used in compliance with these regulations. Server-side analytics can help to protect user privacy by minimizing the amount of data that is collected and shared with third-party services.

- Flexibility: Server-side analytics can provide more flexibility in terms of what data is collected and how it is processed. This can be particularly useful for organizations with complex or custom data requirements.
